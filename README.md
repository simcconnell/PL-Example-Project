# PL-Example-Project

This repository exists only for the purpose of my current job search. Its goal is to demonstrate my coding style.

This project contains several files designed to take a cursory look at Premier League data. While it does contain a couple of methods using neural networks, it is centered primarily around sklearn.svm.SVR. This is not the best way to accurately predict outcomes of matches, nor do I use features which are appropriate for predicting results. I selected this method because its output is relatively straightforward to interpret. I designed this project mostly to satisfy a mild curiosity about the correlation between various match statistics and the final outcome.

I used data available at https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php.
